In this project, we lear how to use shell variables and expansions.
This is what each script does:

0-alias creates an alias.
1-hello_you prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user.
2-path adds /action to the PATH. 
3-paths counts the number of directories in the PATH.
4-global_variables lists environment variables.
5-local_variables lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
6-create_local_variable creates a new local variable and sets a value.
7-create_global_variable creates a new global variable.
8-true_knowledge prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, followed by a new line.
9-divide_and_rule prints the result of POWER divided by DIVIDE, followed by a new line, where POWER and DIVIDE are environment variables.
10-love_exponent_breath 11-binary_to_decimal displays the result of BREATH to the power LOVE (local variables).
11-binary_to_decimal converts a number from base 2 to base 10.
12-combinations 13-print_float 14-decimal_to_hexadecimal prints all possible combinations of two letters, except oo.
with these restrictions:
Letters are lower cases, from a to z
One combination per line
The output should be alpha ordered, starting with aa
Do not print oo
Your script file should contain maximum 64 characters
13-print_float prints a number with two decimal places.The number will be stored in the environment variable NUM.
14-decimal_to_hexadecimal converts a number from base 10 to base 16.
